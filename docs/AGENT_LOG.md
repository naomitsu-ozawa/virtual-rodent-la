# Agent Log

This file is a running record of work done on this repository by AI coding
agents (Claude or others). It exists so that any agent picking up work later
has enough context to continue without re-deriving decisions from scratch.

## How to use this file

- **Before starting work**: read `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the
  feature roadmap, then read the most recent entries here for context on
  what was just done and why.
- **One branch per task.** Name branches descriptively
  (`chore/...`, `refactor/...`, `feat/...`, `test/...`).
- **When finishing a session or task**, append a new entry below (newest on
  top) using the template. Do not edit or delete prior entries — this is an
  append-only log.
- Commit messages should explain *why*, not just *what*; this file is for
  the fuller context that doesn't fit in a commit message (alternatives
  considered, open questions, follow-up work).

## 2026-09-26 — chore/cleanup-previews-promote-185

**Agent:** Claude (Sonnet, via claude.ai)
**Task:** Repository cleanup (priority #1 from planning discussion) — retire
committed preview snapshots and promote the newest preview to be the
canonical `docs/` build.

### What changed
- Created branch `archive/previews`, pointing at the pre-cleanup `main`
  commit (`a776076`), before any deletion. This branch is the permanent
  archive of `docs/preview-137` through `docs/preview-185` (49 snapshot
  directories, ~25 MB) and the previously-deployed build 172. Nothing was
  deleted from git history — `archive/previews` and `main`'s prior history
  both still contain the full previous state.
- Discovered that `docs/preview-185` was actually *ahead* of the live
  `docs/app.js` (build 172 on `main` vs. build 185 in the newest preview).
  Per instruction, promoted build 185 to be the canonical build:
  - `docs/preview-185/{app.js,style.css,medical-volume.js,index.html}` →
    copied over the corresponding `docs/` files.
  - `docs/version.json` updated to `{"build": "185", "version":
    "2026.09.25-185"}`.
- Removed all 49 `docs/preview-*` directories from the working tree
  (`git rm -r`), since they are preserved on `archive/previews`.
- Added this file (`docs/AGENT_LOG.md`) to establish the work-log
  convention going forward.

### Why
- The repo owner asked to "evacuate" (退避) rather than destroy the preview
  history — a branch preserves it without rewriting git history (no force
  push, no broken clones/forks) while getting the dead weight off `main`.
- Promoting build 185 rather than keeping build 172 was an explicit
  instruction after we found 185 was newer and internally self-consistent
  (its own `index.html`/`app.js` cache-busting query strings already matched
  each other at `build185`).

### Follow-up / open questions
- Root-level `index.html` (project root, used for local `vite` dev) points
  to `/docs/style.css` and `/docs/app.js` with **no cache-busting query
  string**, unlike `docs/index.html` which pins
  `?v=20260925-build185`. This was pre-existing and left as-is, but worth
  deciding whether local dev should also cache-bust.
- Did not diff build 172 → 185 line-by-line for behavior changes; worth a
  quick read-through before assuming build 185 is safe, since the repo
  owner may not have manually reviewed every incremental preview either.
- Next priorities per the ranking discussion: (1) this cleanup — done, then
  (2) test infrastructure, (3) splitting `docs/app.js` into modules,
  (4) feature work from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s "Next priorities".
